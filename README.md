# NER
This project took Business Insider articles from 2013-2014 and extracted the names of all CEOs, companies, and percentages
from the data. 

For each of the three goals, a Named Entity Recognizer (NER) based on logistic regression was built. The results from this were
used to help build a Question Answer (QA) system.
